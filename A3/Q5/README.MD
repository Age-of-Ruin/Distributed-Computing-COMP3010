# Recursive DOM Walk using JS
Question 5 implements a simple Javascript program that recursively walks through the Document Object Model (DOM) and prints the hierarchal tags to the browser. The javascript is executed immediatedly once the page has been lauched by a web browser. 

Note: This implementation logs/prints the output to the browsers console. On Chrome this is usually accessed via right-clicking the browswer window and selecting 'inspect' or 'inspect source code'. Finally, navigate to the console and view the output.
