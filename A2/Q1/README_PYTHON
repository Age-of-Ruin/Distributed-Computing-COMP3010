The file Q1_Client_Python.py implements a simple banking system client which connects to the Java server (ie Q1_Server.java) developed in A1 - however the client has been reconstructed in the Python scripting language. Commands offered by the client are as follows:

** Note: The server MUST be running on 'owl.cs.umanitoba.ca' - this is where the client connects**

C<x> where x = account number (int)
R<x> where x = account number (int)
D<x,y> where x = account number & y = dollar amount (int)
W<x,y> where x = account number & y = dollar amount (int)
